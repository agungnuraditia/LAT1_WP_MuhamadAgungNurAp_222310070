<h1><b>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages
    to Learn in 2022</b>
</h1>

<p> There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The <span style="color: red;"> U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics </span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from
2018 to 2028, which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s
more, the median annual pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which
is nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.</p>
<p>
Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies,
and types of software require knowing and understanding different
programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple
languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a
daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming
experience.</p>
The <span style="color: rgb(73, 117, 199);"><u> of Science in Computer Science Align program </u></span> at Northeastern
University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into
computer science from another field of study.

<p><i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds
and have them come out as software engineers,”</i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and
director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern
University—Seattle. <i> “We focus on math, programming, and a variety of
computer science and engineering concepts.”</i>

<p class="right-align">Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it
helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most
popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings
listed on job search sites Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and
factors such as ease of use and potential for growth
